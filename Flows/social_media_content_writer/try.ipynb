Also, since all chunks are of equal size, it simplifies batch processing.\\n\\nBut there is a big problem. This usually breaks sentences (or ideas) in between. Thus, important information will likely get distributed between chunks.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 2) Semantic chunking\\n\\nThe idea is simple.\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tmOD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6ad83a6-2879-4c77-9e49-393f16577aef_1066x288.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tmOD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6ad83a6-2879-4c77-9e49-393f16577aef_1066x288.gif)\\n\\n- Segment the document based on meaningful units like sentences, paragraphs, or thematic sections.\\n\\n- Next, create embeddings for each segment.\\n\\n- Let’s say I start with the first segment and its embedding.\\n\\n  - If the first segment’s embedding has a high cosine similarity with that of the second segment, both segments form a chunk.\\n\\n  - This continues until cosine similarity drops significantly.\\n\\n  - The moment it does, we start a new chunk and repeat.\\n\\nHere’s what the output could look like:\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTc2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74037e11-362d-4ea2-8ee2-ee85ab013523_963x231.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTc2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74037e11-362d-4ea2-8ee2-ee85ab013523_963x231.png)\\n\\nUnlike fixed-size chunks, this maintains the natural flow of language and preserves complete ideas.\\n\\nSince each chunk is richer, it improves the retrieval accuracy, which, in turn, produces more coherent and relevant responses by the LLM.\\n\\nA minor problem is that it depends on a threshold to determine if cosine similarity has dropped significantly, which can vary from document to document.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 3) Recursive chunking\\n\\nThis is also simple.\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WRuN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4009caa-34fc-48d6-8102-3d0f6f2c1386_1066x316.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WRuN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4009caa-34fc-48d6-8102-3d0f6f2c1386_1066x316.gif)\\n\\nFirst, chunk based on inherent separators like paragraphs, or sections.\\n\\nNext, split each chunk into smaller chunks if the size exceeds a pre-defined chunk size limit. If, however, the chunk fits the chunk-size limit, no further splitting is done.\\n\\nHere’s what the output could look like:\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5-DV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0e40cc1-996f-48f4-9306-781b112536e4_984x428.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5-DV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0e40cc1-996f-48f4-9306-781b112536e4_984x428.png)\\n\\nAs shown above:\\n\\n- First, we define two chunks (the two paragraphs in purple).\\n\\n- Next, paragraph 1 is further split into smaller chunks.\\n\\n\\nUnlike fixed-size chunks, this approach also maintains the natural flow of language and preserves complete ideas.\\n\\nHowever, there is some extra overhead in terms of implementation and computational complexity.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 4) Document structure-based chunking\\n\\nThis is another intuitive approach.\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NtgT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8febecd-ee68-42ff-ab06-41a0a3a43cd3_1102x306.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NtgT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8febecd-ee68-42ff-ab06-41a0a3a43cd3_1102x306.gif)\\n\\nIt utilizes the inherent structure of documents, like headings, sections, or paragraphs, to define chunk boundaries.\\n\\nThis way, it maintains structural integrity by aligning with the document’s logical sections.\\n\\nHere’s what the output could look like:\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9CjT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bdaf3b-601d-4357-bc7f-89b47f812097_1025x663.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9CjT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bdaf3b-601d-4357-bc7f-89b47f812097_1025x663.png)\\n\\nThat said, this approach assumes that the document has a clear structure, which may not be true.\\n\\nAlso, chunks may vary in length, possibly exceeding model token limits. You can try merging it with recursive splitting.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 5) LLM-based chunking\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jVmL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d1b6d60-8956-4030-8525-d899ee61a9d5_1140x198.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jVmL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d1b6d60-8956-4030-8525-d899ee61a9d5_1140x198.gif)\\n\\nSince every approach has upsides and downsides, why not use the LLM to create chunks?\\n\\nThe LLM can be prompted to generate semantically isolated and meaningful chunks.\\n\\nQuite evidently, this method will ensure high semantic accuracy since the LLM can understand context and meaning beyond simple heuristics (used in the above four approaches).\\n\\nThe only problem is that it is the most computationally demanding chunking technique of all five techniques discussed here.\\n\\nAlso, since LLMs typically have a limited context window, that is something to be taken care of.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nEach technique has its own advantages and trade-offs.\\n\\nI have observed that semantic chunking works pretty well in many cases, but again, you need to test.\\n\\nThe choice will heavily depend on the nature of your content, the capabilities of the embedding model, computational resources, etc.\\n\\nWe shall be doing a hands-on demo of these strategies pretty soon.\\n\\nIn the meantime, in case you missed it, yesterday, we discussed techniques to build robust NLP systems that rely on pairwise content similarity (RAG is one of them).\\n\\nRead here: **[Bi-encoders and Cross-encoders for Sentence Pair Similarity Scoring – Part 1](https://www.dailydoseofds.com/bi-encoders-and-cross-encoders-for-sentence-pair-similarity-scoring-part-1/)**.\\n\\n👉 Over to you: What other chunking strategies do you know?\\n\\nThanks for reading Daily Dose of Data Science!

simple heuristics (used in the above four approaches).</p><p>The only problem is that it is the most computationally demanding chunking technique of all five techniques discussed here.</p><p>Also,

Also, since all chunks are of equal size, it simplifies batch processing.\\n\\nBut there is a big problem. This usually breaks sentences (or ideas) in between. Thus, important information will likely get distributed between chunks.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 2) Semantic chunking\\n\\nThe idea is simple.\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tmOD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6ad83a6-2879-4c77-9e49-393f16577aef_1066x288.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tmOD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6ad83a6-2879-4c77-9e49-393f16577aef_1066x288.gif)\\n\\n- Segment the document based on meaningful units like sentences, paragraphs, or thematic sections.\\n\\n- Next, create embeddings for each segment.\\n\\n- Let’s say I start with the first segment and its embedding.\\n\\n  - If the first segment’s embedding has a high cosine similarity with that of the second segment, both segments form a chunk.\\n\\n  - This continues until cosine similarity drops significantly.\\n\\n  - The moment it does, we start a new chunk and repeat.\\n\\nHere’s what the output could look like:\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTc2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74037e11-362d-4ea2-8ee2-ee85ab013523_963x231.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTc2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74037e11-362d-4ea2-8ee2-ee85ab013523_963x231.png)\\n\\nUnlike fixed-size chunks, this maintains the natural flow of language and preserves complete ideas.\\n\\nSince each chunk is richer, it improves the retrieval accuracy, which, in turn, produces more coherent and relevant responses by the LLM.\\n\\nA minor problem is that it depends on a threshold to determine if cosine similarity has dropped significantly, which can vary from document to document.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 3) Recursive chunking\\n\\nThis is also simple.\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WRuN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4009caa-34fc-48d6-8102-3d0f6f2c1386_1066x316.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WRuN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4009caa-34fc-48d6-8102-3d0f6f2c1386_1066x316.gif)\\n\\nFirst, chunk based on inherent separators like paragraphs, or sections.\\n\\nNext, split each chunk into smaller chunks if the size exceeds a pre-defined chunk size limit. If, however, the chunk fits the chunk-size limit, no further splitting is done.\\n\\nHere’s what the output could look like:\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5-DV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0e40cc1-996f-48f4-9306-781b112536e4_984x428.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5-DV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0e40cc1-996f-48f4-9306-781b112536e4_984x428.png)\\n\\nAs shown above:\\n\\n- First, we define two chunks (the two paragraphs in purple).\\n\\n- Next, paragraph 1 is further split into smaller chunks.\\n\\n\\nUnlike fixed-size chunks, this approach also maintains the natural flow of language and preserves complete ideas.\\n\\nHowever, there is some extra overhead in terms of implementation and computational complexity.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 4) Document structure-based chunking\\n\\nThis is another intuitive approach.\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NtgT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8febecd-ee68-42ff-ab06-41a0a3a43cd3_1102x306.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NtgT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8febecd-ee68-42ff-ab06-41a0a3a43cd3_1102x306.gif)\\n\\nIt utilizes the inherent structure of documents, like headings, sections, or paragraphs, to define chunk boundaries.\\n\\nThis way, it maintains structural integrity by aligning with the document’s logical sections.\\n\\nHere’s what the output could look like:\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9CjT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bdaf3b-601d-4357-bc7f-89b47f812097_1025x663.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9CjT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40bdaf3b-601d-4357-bc7f-89b47f812097_1025x663.png)\\n\\nThat said, this approach assumes that the document has a clear structure, which may not be true.\\n\\nAlso, chunks may vary in length, possibly exceeding model token limits. You can try merging it with recursive splitting.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n### 5) LLM-based chunking\\n\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jVmL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d1b6d60-8956-4030-8525-d899ee61a9d5_1140x198.gif)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jVmL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d1b6d60-8956-4030-8525-d899ee61a9d5_1140x198.gif)\\n\\nSince every approach has upsides and downsides, why not use the LLM to create chunks?\\n\\nThe LLM can be prompted to generate semantically isolated and meaningful chunks.\\n\\nQuite evidently, this method will ensure high semantic accuracy since the LLM can understand context and meaning beyond simple heuristics (used in the above four approaches).\\n\\nThe only problem is that it is the most computationally demanding chunking technique of all five techniques discussed here.\\n\\nAlso, since LLMs typically have a limited context window, that is something to be taken care of.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nEach technique has its own advantages and trade-offs.\\n\\nI have observed that semantic chunking works pretty well in many cases, but again, you need to test.\\n\\nThe choice will heavily depend on the nature of your content, the capabilities of the embedding model, computational resources, etc.\\n\\nWe shall be doing a hands-on demo of these strategies pretty soon.\\n\\nIn the meantime, in case you missed it, yesterday, we discussed techniques to build robust NLP systems that rely on pairwise content similarity (RAG is one of them).\\n\\nRead here: **[Bi-encoders and Cross-encoders for Sentence Pair Similarity Scoring – Part 1](https://www.dailydoseofds.com/bi-encoders-and-cross-encoders-for-sentence-pair-similarity-scoring-part-1/)**.\\n\\n👉 Over to you: What other chunking strategies do you know?\\n\\nThanks for reading Daily Dose of Data Science!
